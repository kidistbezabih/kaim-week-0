# üåû MoonLight Energy Solutions: Solar Radiation Dashboard
## üìã Project Summary

Welcome to the MoonLight Energy Solutions Dashboard! This project provides insightful visualizations and analyses of solar radiation, wind speed, temperature, and related environmental factors. It is designed to aid decision-making in solar energy investments.
Key Objectives:

    Analyze solar radiation data across regions (Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo).
    Discover trends, patterns, and anomalies through statistical analysis and visualization.
    Use Streamlit to explore the interplay between wind conditions, temperature, and solar radiation.

## üèÜ Core Features
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Analyze trends in solar radiation metrics:
        Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI).
        Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI).
        Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI).
    Detect anomalies in GHI using outlier detection techniques.
    Examine correlations among environmental variables like GHI, wind speed, humidity, and temperature.

2. Interactive Streamlit Dashboard

    Dynamic and user-friendly interface to explore data insights.
    Key features include:
        Correlation heatmaps.
        Time-series analysis of environmental factors.
        Wind-solar relationship exploration.
        Outlier detection visualizations.
